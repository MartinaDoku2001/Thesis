\chapter{Introduction}
The chapter is built as follows: in the first section there is a brief
introduction of the problem, the reasons that led to the choice of the
topic and the outline of the thesis. In the second section there is the
statement of the research questions. In the third section there is a brief
description of the basic concepts.
\section{Problem statement}
What is EEG in the first place and why is it important? Electroencephalography 
(EEG) is a non-invasive technique used to measure the electrical activity of
the brain. EEG signals are still among the less explored ones in the
field of signal processing, despite their widespread use in clinical 
practice and research. In recent years, there has been a growing 
interest in developing denoising methods for EEG data to improve their 
quality and reliability.


The main objective of this thesis is to investigate and compare different
 EEG denoising methods, and to evaluate their performance in terms of 
 signal quality, artifact removal, and preservation of underlying brain
activity. Specifically, we will focus on the most recent machine learning
techniques, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), autoencoders
(AEs), and deep learning (DL) models. We will also investigate the 
potential of combining different denoising methods to improve the 
performance of EEG denoising.


Overall, this thesis aims to provide a better understanding of the strengths
 and limitations of different EEG denoising methods, and to help researchers
  and clinicians make informed decisions when selecting the most appropriate
   denoising method for their EEG data analysis. By improving the quality of
    EEG signals, we can enhance our understanding of brain function and 
    ultimately contribute to the development of more effective diagnostic 
    and therapeutic tools for neurological disorders.

\section{Research questions}
The research questions are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item How can we remove artifacts from EEG signals?
\item How can we exploit the most recent machine learning techniques for
    EEG denoising?
\item What are the strengths and limitations of these new methods?
\item What are the performance of these new methods?
\end{itemize}
\section{Basic concepts}
In this section we will introduce the basic concepts that will be used 
in the thesis. The first part is dedicated to the EEG signal, the second
part is dedicated to the EEG denoising.
\subsection{EEG}
When talking about EEG,in this thesis, we are referring to the
 electroencephalogram, in particular we are interested in the 
 EEG waves. Electroencephalogram (EEG) waves are the patterns 
 of electrical activity that are recorded by EEG measurements. 
 These waves have different frequencies and amplitudes, and they 
 reveal different states of brain activity. We divide the EEG waves in 
 5 main categories depending on their frquency:Alpha, Beta, Theta, 
 Delta and Gamma waves.


 Alpha waves are typically observed when someone is relaxed and awake,
  with a frequency of 8-13 Hz. Beta waves, on the other hand, are 
  associated with active cognitive processing and have a higher frequency 
  of 14-30 Hz. Theta waves are usually observed during drowsiness or
   light sleep and have a frequency of 4-7 Hz, while delta waves are
    typically observed during deep sleep and have a frequency of less 
    than 4 Hz.
 
 Gamma waves have a frequency of 30-100 Hz and are associated with higher 
 cognitive functions such as attention and memory. Mu waves, with a 
 frequency of 8-13 Hz, are observed in the sensorimotor cortex during 
 movement and motor planning.
 
 It's important to remember that EEG waves are not distinct entities but 
 represent a continuous spectrum of activity that can be influenced by
  various factors such as task demands, attention, and emotion. Interpreting EEG waves requires expertise 
  and context since different patterns of EEG activity may reflect 
  different states of brain activity depending on the individual and the 
  experimental conditions. Furthermore, research has shown that EEG waves
   can be useful in clinical diagnosis and prognosis, as well as in the
    assessment of cognitive function and brain injury. Therefore, 
    understanding the various EEG waves and their characteristics 
    can provide valuable insights into brain function and activity.
\subsection{EEG denoising}
EEG signals can be influenced by various factor that alter the real waves 
originated from neural activities, those factors are defined as artifacts. 
The artifacts can be classified as \cite{EEG artifact}: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item intrinsic artifacts:
    artifacts that depend on physiological sources, such as ocular artifacts (EOG)
    that come from eye movement and blinking, muscle artifacts (EMG) and
     cardiac artifacts (ECG)
    \item extrinsic artifacts: artifacts generated from external electromagnetic 
    such as power line noise
    sources.
\end{itemize}
Denoising of EEG data is an essential task to be able to work on data and to
extract meaningful information from it. The denoising process is complex and
it does lead to different level of quality of the data depending on the 
method used, the quality of the data and the type of artifact.\\ \\
There are several challenges \cite{denoising challenges} related both 
to single methods characteristic and general artifact removal.
For example, some methods are computationally expensive and require a lot
of time to be applied, some methods are not able to remove all kind of
artifacts, some methods require a lot of data to be applied. On a general
level, there is the problem of the lack of a standard method to evaluate
the quality of the denoised data and the EEG applications are not 
yet fuly commercial, so there hasn't been a sufficient investment in
hardware and software to make the denoising process easier.\\ \\
However the main goal of latest studies is to find a method that can
denoise from all kind of artifacts and that can be used in a flexible
and fast way, to accomodate the needs of all the different EEG applications.
\chapter{Literature review}
In this chapter we will present the main methods used for the denoising
of EEG data. In the first part we will focus on the methods used for the
removal of artifacts from signals in general, in the second part we will
present the ones specifically deveolopped for the denoising of EEG data and in the third
part we will explore the latest, machine learning related, methods.
\section{Signal analysis}
In this section we will present the basic techniques used for the analysis
of signals that 
constituted a base for the ones developed for the analysis of EEG data.
\subsection{Fourier transform}
\label{sec:fourier}
The first method used for the removal of artifacts from signals is the
Fourier transform \cite{fourier}. The Fourier transform is a mathematical tool used
 used to decompose a signal into sine and cosine functions, that are 
used as basis functions for the original signal.
It is defined as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fourier}
F(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-i\omega t} dt
\end{equation}

where $f(t)$ is the signal and $\omega$ is the frequency. The Fourier
transform of a signal is a complex number, which can be decomposed into
its real and imaginary parts. The real part of the Fourier transform
is called the amplitude and the imaginary part is called the phase.

\subsection{Fast Fourier transform}
\label{sec:fft}
The Fourier transform is a very useful tool for the analysis of signals,
but it is computationally expensive. The Fast Fourier transform (FFT) \cite{fft} is
an algorithm that is used to calculate the Fourier transform
of a signal in a shorter time: it reduces the time nedded to Nlog (N),
 obtaining a speed-up of a factor of N/log (N).\newline
The FFT is used  in many different fields of science such as
signal processing, image processing, etc. .

\subsection{Short Time Fourier Transform}
\label{sec:stft}
The Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) \cite{stft} \cite{stft2}
is a method used to calculate the
Fourier transform of a signal. It is used with non stationary signals
to find the frequency components of a signal over time.
The STFT equation is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:stft}
S(\tau) = s(t) \cdot h(t-\tau)
\end{equation}
where $s(t)$ is the signal, $h(t)$ is the window function and $\tau$ is
the time. \newline
The STFT can be used to find the frequency components of a signal:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:stft2}
S(\omega)= \frac{1}{2\pi}\cdot \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} s(\tau) \cdot h(t-\tau) e^{-i\omega t} d\tau
\end{equation}
where $s(\tau)$ is the signal, $h(t)$ is the window function and $\omega$
is the frequency. \newline

\subsection{Wigner-Ville distribution}
\label{sec:wvd}
The Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD) \cite{wvd} is a method used to provide
the description of a signal in the time-frequency domain with higher resolution.
It is described by the following equation:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wvd}
W(\tau, \omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} s(t-\tau) \cdot s^*(t-\tau) e^{-2\pi\omega \tau} d\tau
\end{equation}
where $s(t)$ is the signal, $\tau$ is the time and $\omega$ is the frequency.
The main problem of the WVD is that it introduces the so called cross terms.
In fact, for a signal
\begin{equation} x(t)=x_1(t)+x_2(t)
\end{equation}
the corresponding WVD is:
\begin{equation}
WVD(t,f)= WVDx_1(t,f) + WVDx_2(t,f) + 2Re[WVDx_1x_2(t,f)]
\end{equation}
where $2Re[WVDx_1x_2(t,f)]$ is the cross term
which is removable at the expense of a loss of resolution.  \newline

\subsection{Wavelet transform}
\label{sec:wavelet}
The wavelet transform \cite{wavelet} is a method used to find the frequency
components of a signal over time. It is used with non stationary signals and it
provides a better time-frequency resolution than the STFT and the WVD 
since it gives a better simultaneous time-frequency localization. \newline
It expresses the signal as a linear combination of mother wavelets.
The wavelet transform is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wavelet}
W(\tau, \omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} s(t-\tau) \cdot \psi(t-\tau) e^{-2\pi\omega \tau} d\tau
\end{equation}
where $s(t)$ is the signal, $\tau$ is the time, $\omega$ is the frequency
and $\psi(t)$ is the wavelet function. \newline
A possible choice for the wavelet function is the Morlet wavelet:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wavelet2}
\psi(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2c\pi}} \cdot e^{-\frac{t^2}{2c^2}} \cdot e^{i\omega_0 t}
\end{equation}
where $\omega_0$ is the central frequency of the wavelet and $c$ is the
width of the wavelet. \newline

\subsection{Matching Pursuit}
\label{sec:mp}
The Matching Pursuit (MP) \cite{mp} is a greedy algorithm used to approximate a
signal with a linear combination of basis functions called time-frequency 
atoms, selected from a dictionary of functions. \newline
A general family of time-frequency atoms can be generated by scaling, translating 
and modulating a single window function g(t) as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mp}
g_{\gamma}(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{s}} \cdot g(\frac{t-u}{s}) \cdot e^{i\xi t}
\end{equation}
where $\gamma$ is the tuple (s, u, $\xi$) $s$ is the scale, $u$ is the
translation and $\xi$ is the frequency modulation. \newline
The algorithm aims to find a set of atoms $\gamma_1, \gamma_2, \dots, \gamma_N$
that best approximate the signal $f(t)$, i.e.:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mp2}
f(t) \approx \sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i \cdot g_{\gamma}(t)
\end{equation}
where $a_i$ are the expansion coefficients. \newline
The vector f can be decomposed into 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mp3}
f(t) = <f, g_{\gamma}>g_{\gamma} + Rf(t)
\end{equation}
where $R_{f}$ is the residual vector after approximating f in the direction
 of $g_{\gamma}$. \newline
MP iteratively decomposes the residue $R_{f}$  by projecting it on a vector
of D that matches $R_{f}$ at best. \newline
\section{EEG denoising}
\label{sec:denoising}
The denoising of EEG signals is performed using techniques developed from
the field of signal processing, but more suited to the specific characteristics
of EEG signals and artifacts. Here we present the most common methods.
\subsection{Regression}
\label{sec:regression}
The regression method \cite{regression}, considers the EEG signal to be a
linear combination of the artifacts and the clean EEG signal. In particular,
the EEG signal is modeled as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:regression}
EEG = \alpha \cdot EMG + \beta \cdot EOG + \gamma \cdot ECG + \delta \cdot CEEG
\end{equation}
where $EEG$ is the registered EEG signal, $EMG$ is the muscle artifact
, $EOG$ is the ocular artifact,
$ECG$ is the cardiac artifact
and $CEEG$ is the clean EEG signal. \newline
The regression coefficients $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta$ are estimated
using the least squares method. \newline
The regression method is simple and fast, but it doesn't take into account
the temporal correlation between the artifacts and the EEG signal, the so 
called cross terms. Furthermore it requires the knowledge of the artifacts
signals. \newline

\chapter{Methodology}
\section{Data}
The data used in this thesis are the EEG signals of the EEGdenoiseNet 
dataset \cite{EEGdenoiseNet}. It is comprehensive benchmark dataset
 that proves to be an exemplary resource for training and evaluating
  deep learning-based EEG denoising models. It is composed of 4514 clean 
  EEG epochs, 3400 EOG epochs, and 5598 EMG epochs, making it an inclusive 
  and extensive dataset that caters to the needs of researchers and
 practitioners alike.

The incorporation of these various types of epochs in the dataset
enables to generate a considerable number of noisy EEG epochs
with their corresponding ground truth data. As a result, this compilation 
has proven to be an invaluable resource for model training and testing,
 facilitating an enhanced understanding of EEG denoising.
