# EEG Denoising with Transformer Model

## Overview

Welcome to the EEG Denoising project repository! This project focuses on the application of machine learning techniques, specifically Transformers, for denoising EEG signals. The work has been undertaken as part of a Bachelor's Thesis Project, aiming to contribute to the field of EEG signal processing and machine learning.

## Getting Started
